# Identifying-Emerging-Research-Trends-in-Artificial-Intelligence-A-Topic-Modeling-Using-NMF
This project aims to analyze research papers on artificial intelligence (AI) to identify and understand the main research trends. Using data from arXiv, we applied Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) on TF-IDF features extracted from paper abstracts to uncover the underlying topics in the field of AI.
