# Identifying Emerging Research Trends in Artificial Intelligence: A Topic Modeling Using NMF

## Overview

This project involves analyzing research papers on artificial intelligence (AI) to identify and understand the main research trends. Using data from arXiv, we applied **Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)** on **TF-IDF** features extracted from paper abstracts to uncover underlying topics in the field of AI.

## Dataset

- **Source**: arXiv
- **Content**: Abstracts from research papers related to AI, machine learning, and data science.
- **Fields**: Title, Abstract, Published Date

## Methods

1. **Data Collection**: Scraped research paper abstracts from arXiv.
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned and prepared text data.
   - Converted text data into a **TF-IDF** matrix.
3. **Topic Modeling**:
   - Applied **Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)** to the TF-IDF matrix.
   - Extracted topics based on the word distributions.

## Results

The NMF algorithm identified 10 main topics, summarized as follows:

1. **Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Optimization**  
   Focuses on reinforcement learning algorithms, optimization problems, and reward functions.

2. **Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reasoning**  
   Discusses large language models, reasoning tasks, and dataset generation.

3. **Image Features and Visual Information**  
   Relates to image processing, feature extraction, and semantic information.

4. **3D Reconstruction and Diffusion Models**  
   Involves 3D scene reconstruction, diffusion models, and multiview generation.

5. **Object and Anomaly Detection**  
   Examines object detection, anomaly detection, and performance evaluation.

6. **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**  
   Discusses graph structures, node relationships, and GNNs.

7. **Federated Learning (FL)**  
   Focuses on federated learning, model training, and performance metrics.

8. **Medical Imaging and Segmentation**  
   Covers medical image segmentation, automated models, and cancer diagnosis.

9. **AI Systems and Human Interaction**  
   Explores AI systems, human-AI interaction, and research challenges.

10. **Neural Networks and Deep Learning**
